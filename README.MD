# Malware Classification with Random Forest
This is a binary malware classification project built as part of the EL-GY-9133 Machine Learning for Cyber Security course at New York University. The repository contains a trained malware classifier model `malware_classifier_model.joblib`, a file containing a script to run inference on JSON files for the given model `dynamic.py`, and a Jupyter notebook containing model training code and result graphs `random_forest_training.ipynb`.

### Abstract
This projects uses machine learning to perform malware classification on a custom dataset of over 5000 benign and malware files each, totaling 45.59 GB of JSON execution logs. Eleven features relating to system and network activities such as file operations and network communications were extracted from the files to capture differences. A Random Forest classifier was trained on 75% of the data and achieved an accuracy of 100% on a held out test set. Feature importance analysis revealed that network-related features like DNS queries and TCP connections were most significant in distinguishing malware from benign software.


### Requirements
The following python packages are required to run the Jupyter notebooks:
* numpy
* pandas
* os
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* joblib
* sklearn
